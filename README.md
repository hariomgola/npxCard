 Will see you in console in just a minute :eyes:

## Important
 I sincerly admit! I spend a lot of time and non-trivial amount of time for designing and bilding this nx card, and I am proud of it! All I ask you to put a *star* :star: on this project and not claim this effort as your own :heart_on_fire:

## Meet you in console.

### Create your own card
